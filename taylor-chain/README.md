Setup:

Firstly, you will need to install all of the node_modules. There will be 3 locations to do this.

1. From the root folder (taylor-chain), "npm install"
2. Then, "cd api" to get into the api folder, "npm install"
3. "cd ../" back into the root folder and "cd src" into the src folder, "npm install" 

Finally. "cd ../" to get back into the project root folder. 

1. From here, "npm start" to fire up the react front end.


Open a new terminal in the root project folder (taylor-chain)

1. "cd api" to get into the api (backend) folder.
2. "npm run dev" will fire up the backend server.


You should now be fully connected to the project!




========= NOTE =========

You will need multiple terminals to create the p2p network

You can accomplish this by going to the "Peers" page using the upper navBar

Once there, click on the "Connect to the BlockChain" button.
This will spawn a new terminal each time, connected to a different port.

Currently, I've only created files for up to 10 peers to connect. (see shellScripts in api folder if curious)
